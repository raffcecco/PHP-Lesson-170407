Three simple PHP examples:
- Regular HTML + PHP app that adds numbers posted from a form and displays the result.
- An Ajax version of the above.
- An example of classes and inheritance using a superhero theme.

You just need PHP and a web-server, or you can use PHP's handy built-in server like this:

php -S localhost:8080

This will bind the current working directory to localhost,
so you can access the examples with these URLs:
http://localhost/simple
http://localhost/simpleajax
http://localhost/superhero
